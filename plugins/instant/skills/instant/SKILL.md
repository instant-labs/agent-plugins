  Check whether domain names are registered and find alternatives using the
  Instant MCP server. Use whenever the user asks if a domain is
  available, taken, or free; wants to check a name across extensions (.com,
  .io, .ai, .dev, and hundreds more); needs alternatives because a name is
  taken; or is picking a domain for a project, product, startup, or side
  project. Also use when naming a new app or repository and the user wants
  domain registration status checked alongside name ideas. Also use when
  the user asks to search USPTO trademark records or inspect a filing.

# Instant

The `instant` MCP server from [instant.ai](https://instant.ai) reports domain registration status from
the index behind [instantdomainsearch.com](https://instantdomainsearch.com).
It needs no account, API key, or configuration. Every domain result carries a
`research_url`, the domain's research page on instantdomainsearch.com, with its
registration status, registrar prices, and WHOIS details.

## Domain tools

Use these three tools on the `instant` MCP server. Your client may
show them with the server name as a prefix; the tool is the same.

| Tool | Use when | Key arguments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search_domains` | One name, many extensions | `name` (label only, no extension), `tlds` (optional array, no leading dots), `limit` (1-100, default 32) |
| `check_domain_availability` | Specific full domain names | `domains` (array of `label.tld`, at most 50) |
| `generate_domain_variations` | The name is taken and the user wants alternatives on the same root | `name` (label only), `limit` (1-100, default 32) |

### Choosing a tool

- "Is acme.com available?" → `check_domain_availability` with
  `{"domains": ["acme.com"]}`.
- "What extensions can I get acme on?" → `search_domains` with
  `{"name": "acme"}`; add `tlds` when the user names extensions.
- "acme.com is taken, what else?" → `generate_domain_variations` with
  `{"name": "acme"}`, then optionally `search_domains` on the best variations
  with other extensions.
- A list of candidate names → one `check_domain_availability` call with all
  of them (batch, up to 50), not one call per name.

### Argument rules

The server rejects malformed domain input. Normalize before calling so names
and extensions are sent in the expected form:

- `name` is the label only: `acme`, never `acme.com`. Lowercase letters,
  digits, and hyphens; no spaces. Strip spaces from multi-word ideas
  (`"Blue Harbor"` → `blueharbor`).
- `tlds` entries are lowercase with no leading dot: `["com", "io", "co.uk"]`.
- `domains` entries are lowercase full names: `["acme.com", "shop.co.uk"]`.
  The first dot separates label from extension; the server also lowercases names.
- `generate_domain_variations` returns `.com` results only.

## Reading results

Each domain in a result has:

- `label` and `tld`: the two halves of the name.
- `isRegistered`: `true` (in the zone or observed in DNS), `false` (extension
  covered, name absent), or `null` (the index has no data for that extension).
  `search_domains` reports `false` where `check_domain_availability` would
  report `null`, so confirm an unusual extension with
  `check_domain_availability` before calling it available.
- `rank`: how common the extension is, higher is more common.
- `listings` and `markets`: aftermarket listings when the name is for sale.
  `premium` with `is_premium: true` means the registry prices the name above
  standard.
- All prices are USD cents: `premium.usd_cents`, `listings.lowestPrice`, and
  `markets[].price`. `400000` is $4,000.
- `research_url`: the domain's research page on instantdomainsearch.com.

Status comes from the search index, built from registry zone files and DNS
observation feeds, not from a live registry query. Say "not registered as of
the last index build" rather than promising the name is free. Link to the
research page and tell the user to confirm availability with a registrar
before registering it.

## Presenting results

- Lead with what the user asked for: available names first, then taken names.
- Render `research_url` as a markdown link on the domain name, for example `[acme.io](https://instantdomainsearch.com/research?q=acme.io&src=mcp)`.
- Treat `null` as unknown, not available.
- Mention aftermarket listings and premium prices when present; a listing alone does not prove the domain is registered.
- Do not list every field. Name, status, and the link are enough unless the user asks for more.

## Trademark tools

When the user asks about trademarks, call `search_trademarks` on the `instant`
server with `query` set to the mark text. Keep spaces and Unicode in trademark
queries. Optional `mode` is `exact`, `prefix`, `fuzzy` (default), or `phonetic`;
`limit` is 1-100 (default 20). Use `statuses`, `classes`, and `owner` only when
the user supplies those constraints.

Call `get_trademark_details` with the returned eight-digit `serialNumber` as
`serial_number` to inspect a filing. Preserve leading zeros. Report the record's status, relevant
goods and services, and snapshot freshness. An empty search or an available
domain does not establish trademark clearance.

## Example

User: "I'm building a CLI called shipwright. Can I get the domain?"

1. Call `search_domains` with `{"name": "shipwright", "tlds": ["com", "dev", "io", "sh"]}`.
2. If every result is registered, call `generate_domain_variations` with `{"name": "shipwright", "limit": 10}`.
3. Reply with the available names and their research links, and note which were taken.
